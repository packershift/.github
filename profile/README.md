# Welcome!

Collaboration, community and curiosity - all essential to a vibrant open source ethos and part of PackerShift’s culture. You’ll find us throughout the open source community, contributing to automating open source projects. But we’re also hard at work solving technical challenges with innovative approaches and releasing those ideas as new open source projects. We’re proud of the creativity and contributions of PackerShift contributor's - from small but mighty open source projects to large, headline-grabbing community projects.

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
